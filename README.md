# Generalized_Linear_Models_KUL
Code for seminars and final project for KU Leuven course "Generalized Linear Models".

1st seminar uses logit, quasi-likelihood and beta-binomial models to find out whenever treatment has an effect of mortality rate of ewes infected with intestine worms.

2nd seminar uses Poisson model (and its various extensions to deal with overdispersion and zero count inflation) to reliably model number of homicide victims a person knows.

Main aim of the final project is to predict the probability of a person's income level (higher or lower than 50K) as a function of the other 7 covariates. For this purpose various variations of logit models are fitted.
